   resource stream_filter_prepend    ( resource $stream   , string $filtername   [, int $read_write   [, mixed $params  ]] )
说明:
Addsfilternametothelistoffiltersattachedtostream.
参数:
  参数              stream                  The target stream.                        filtername                  The filter name.                        read_write                  By default, stream_filter_prepend() will       attach the filter to the read filter chain       if the file was opened for reading (i.e. File Mode:       r, and/or +).  The filter       will also be attached to the write filter chain       if the file was opened for writing (i.e. File Mode:       w, a, and/or +).       STREAM_FILTER_READ,       STREAM_FILTER_WRITE, and/or       STREAM_FILTER_ALL can also be passed to the       read_write parameter to override this behavior.       See stream_filter_append() for an example of       using this parameter.                        params                  This filter will be added with the specified params       to the beginning of the list and will therefore be       called first during stream operations.  To add a filter to the end of the       list, use stream_filter_append().                     
返回值:
  返回值     Returns a resource which can be used to refer to this filter   instance during a call to stream_filter_remove().

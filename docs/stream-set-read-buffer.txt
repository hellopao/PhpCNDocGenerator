参数:
  参数         stream               The file pointer.                   buffer               The number of bytes to buffer. If buffer      is 0 then read operations are unbuffered.  This ensures that all reads      with fread() are completed before other processes are      allowed to read from that input stream.               
返回值:
  返回值     Returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request   cannot be honored.

语法:
   int stream_set_write_buffer    ( resource $stream   , int $buffer   )
说明:
Setsthebufferingforwriteoperationsonthegivenstreamtobufferbytes.
参数:
  参数              stream                  The file pointer.                        buffer                  The number of bytes to buffer. If buffer       is 0 then write operations are unbuffered.  This ensures that all writes       with fwrite() are completed before other processes are       allowed to write to that output stream.                     
返回值:
  返回值     Returns 0 on success, or EOF if the request cannot be honored.   
示例:

     The following example demonstrates how to use
     stream_set_write_buffer() to create an unbuffered stream.
    
<?php
$fp = fopen($file, "w");
if ($fp) {
  stream_set_write_buffer($fp, 0);
  fwrite($fp, $output);
  fclose($fp);
}
?>

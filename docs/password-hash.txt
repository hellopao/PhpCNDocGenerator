语法:
   string password_hash    ( string $password   , integer $algo   [, array $options  ] )
说明:
password_hash()createsanewpasswordhashusingastrongone-wayhashingalgorithm.password_hash()iscompatiblewithcrypt().Therefore,passwordhashescreatedbycrypt()canbeusedwithpassword_hash().
参数:
  参数         password               用户的密码。           Caution               Using the PASSWORD_BCRYPT for the        algo parameter, will result        in the password parameter being truncated to a        maximum length of 72 characters.             
返回值:
  返回值     Returns the hashed password,  或者在失败时返回 FALSE.       The used algorithm, cost and salt are returned as part of the hash. Therefore,   all information that&#039;s needed to verify the hash is included in it. This allows   the password_verify() function to verify the hash without   needing separate storage for the salt or algorithm information.   
示例:

<?php
/**
 * We just want to hash our password using the current DEFAULT algorithm.
 * This is presently BCRYPT, and will produce a 60 character result.
 *
 * Beware that DEFAULT may change over time, so you would want to prepare
 * By allowing your storage to expand past 60 characters (255 would be good)
 */
echo password_hash("rasmuslerdorf", PASSWORD_DEFAULT)."\n";
?>
以上例程的输出类似于：
$2y$10$.vGA1O9wmRjrwAVXD98HNOgsNpDczlqm3Jq7KnEd1rVAGv3Fykk1a

<?php
/**
 * In this case, we want to increase the default cost for BCRYPT to 12.
 * Note that we also switched to BCRYPT, which will always be 60 characters.
 */
$options = [
    'cost' => 12,
];
echo password_hash("rasmuslerdorf", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $options)."\n";
?>
以上例程的输出类似于：
$2y$12$QjSH496pcT5CEbzjD/vtVeH03tfHKFy36d4J0Ltp3lRtee9HDxY3K

<?php
/**
 * Note that the salt here is randomly generated.
 * Never use a static salt or one that is not randomly generated.
 *
 * For the VAST majority of use-cases, let password_hash generate the salt randomly for you
 */
$options = [
    'cost' => 11,
    'salt' => mcrypt_create_iv(22, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM),
];
echo password_hash("rasmuslerdorf", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $options)."\n";
?>
以上例程的输出类似于：

<?php
/**
 * This code will benchmark your server to determine how high of a cost you can
 * afford. You want to set the highest cost that you can without slowing down
 * you server too much. 8-10 is a good baseline, and more is good if your servers
 * are fast enough. The code below aims for ≤ 50 milliseconds stretching time,
 * which is a good baseline for systems handling interactive logins.

$timeTarget = 0.05; // 50 milliseconds 
$cost = 8;
do {
    $cost++;
    $start = microtime(true);
    password_hash("test", PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ["cost" => $cost]);
    $end = microtime(true);

语法:
   bool odbc_execute    ( resource $result_id   [, array $parameters_array  ] )
说明:
Executesastatementpreparedwithodbc_prepare().
参数:
  参数              result_id                  The result id resource, from odbc_prepare().                        parameters_array                  Parameters in parameter_array will be       substituted for placeholders in the prepared statement in order.       Elements of this array will be converted to strings by calling this       function.                   Any parameters in parameter_array which       start and end with single quotes will be taken as the name of a       file to read and send to the database server as the data for the       appropriate placeholder.                   If you wish to store a string which actually begins and ends with       single quotes, you must add a space or other non-single-quote character       to the beginning or end of the parameter, which will prevent the       parameter from being taken as a file name. If this is not an option,       then you must use another mechanism to store the string, such as       executing the query directly with odbc_exec()).                     
返回值:
  返回值     成功时返回 TRUE， 或者在失败时返回 FALSE。   
示例:

     In the following code, $success will only be
     TRUE if all three parameters to myproc are IN parameters:
    
<?php
$a = 1;
$b = 2;
$c = 3;
$stmt    = odbc_prepare($conn, 'CALL myproc(?,?,?)');
$success = odbc_execute($stmt, array($a, $b, $c));
?>

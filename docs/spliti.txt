语法:
   array spliti    ( string $pattern   , string $string   [, int $limit = -1  ] )
说明:
用正则表达式将一个string分割成数组。
参数:
  参数              pattern                  大小写不敏感的正则表达式。                   If you want to split on any of the characters which are considered       special by regular expressions, you&#039;ll need to escape them first. If       you think spliti() (or any other regex function, for       that matter) is doing something weird, please read the file       regex.7, included in the        regex/ subdirectory of the PHP distribution. It&#039;s       in manpage format, so you&#039;ll want to do something along the lines of       man /usr/local/src/regex/regex.7 in order to read it.                        string                  输入的字符。                        limit                  如果设置了 limit，返回的数组最多会包含 limit 个元素，最后一个元素包含了剩下的全部  string。                     
返回值:
  返回值     Returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of   string formed by splitting it on boundaries formed   by the case insensitive regular expression pattern.       If there are n occurrences of   pattern, the returned array will contain   n+1 items. For example, if   there is no occurrence of pattern, an array with   only one element will be returned. Of course, this is also true if   string is empty. If an error occurs,   spliti() returns FALSE.   
示例:

<?php
$string = "aBBBaCCCADDDaEEEaGGGA";
$chunks = spliti ("a", $string, 5);
print_r($chunks);
?>
以上例程会输出：
Array
(
  [0] =>
  [1] => BBB
  [2] => CCC
  [3] => DDD
  [4] => EEEaGGGA
)

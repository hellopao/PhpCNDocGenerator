语法:
   mixed count_chars    ( string $string   [, int $mode = 0  ] )
说明:
统计string中每个字节值（0..255）出现的次数，使用多种模式返回结果。
参数:
  参数              string                  需要统计的字符串。                        mode                  参见返回的值。                     
返回值:
  返回值     根据不同的   mode，count_chars()   返回下列不同的结果：                  0 - 以所有的每个字节值作为键名，出现次数作为值的数组。                        1 - 与 0 相同，但只列出出现次数大于零的字节值。                        2 - 与 0 相同，但只列出出现次数等于零的字节值。                        3 - 返回由所有使用了的字节值组成的字符串。                       4 - 返回由所有未使用的字节值组成的字符串。               
示例:

<?php
$data = "Two Ts and one F.";
foreach (count_chars($data, 1) as $i => $val) {
   echo "There were $val instance(s) of \"" , chr($i) , "\" in the string.\n";
}
?>
以上例程会输出：
There were 4 instance(s) of " " in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "." in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "F" in the string.
There were 2 instance(s) of "T" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "a" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "d" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "e" in the string.
There were 2 instance(s) of "n" in the string.
There were 2 instance(s) of "o" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "s" in the string.
There were 1 instance(s) of "w" in the string.

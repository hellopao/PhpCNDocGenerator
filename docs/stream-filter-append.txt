   resource stream_filter_append    ( resource $stream   , string $filtername   [, int $read_write   [, mixed $params  ]] )
说明:
Addsfilternametothelistoffiltersattachedtostream.
参数:
  参数              stream                  The target stream.                        filtername                  The filter name.                        read_write                  By default, stream_filter_append() will       attach the filter to the read filter chain       if the file was opened for reading (i.e. File Mode:       r, and/or +).  The filter       will also be attached to the write filter chain       if the file was opened for writing (i.e. File Mode:       w, a, and/or +).       STREAM_FILTER_READ,       STREAM_FILTER_WRITE, and/or       STREAM_FILTER_ALL can also be passed to the       read_write parameter to override this behavior.                        params                  This filter will be added with the specified        params to the end of       the list and will therefore be called last during stream operations.       To add a filter to the beginning of the list, use       stream_filter_prepend().                     
返回值:
  返回值     Returns a resource which can be used to refer to this filter   instance during a call to stream_filter_remove().   
示例:

<?php
/* Open a test file for reading and writing */
$fp = fopen('test.txt', 'w+');
/* Apply the ROT13 filter to the
 * write filter chain, but not the
 * read filter chain */
stream_filter_append($fp, "string.rot13", STREAM_FILTER_WRITE);
/* Write a simple string to the file
 * it will be ROT13 transformed on the
 * way out */
fwrite($fp, "This is a test\n");
/* Back up to the beginning of the file */
rewind($fp);
/* Read the contents of the file back out.
 * Had the filter been applied to the
 * read filter chain as well, we would see
 * the text ROT13ed back to its original state */
fpassthru($fp);
fclose($fp);
/* Expected Output

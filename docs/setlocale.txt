说明:
Setslocaleinformation.
参数:
  参数              category                  category is a named constant specifying the       category of the functions affected by the locale setting:                                  LC_ALL for all of the below                                            LC_COLLATE for string comparison, see          strcoll()                                            LC_CTYPE for character classification and conversion, for          example strtoupper()                                            LC_MONETARY for localeconv()                                            LC_NUMERIC for decimal separator (See also          localeconv())                                            LC_TIME for date and time formatting with          strftime()                                            LC_MESSAGES for system responses (available if PHP was compiled with          libintl)                                                locale                  If locale is NULL or the empty string       &quot;&quot;, the locale names will be set from the       values of environment variables with the same names as the above       categories, or from &quot;LANG&quot;.                   If locale is &quot;0&quot;,       the locale setting is not affected, only the current setting is returned.                   If locale is an array or followed by additional       parameters then each array element or parameter is tried to be set as       new locale until success. This is useful if a locale is known under       different names on different systems or for providing a fallback       for a possibly not available locale.                        ...                  (Optional string or array parameters to try as locale settings until       success.)                     Note:          On Windows, setlocale(LC_ALL, &#039;&#039;) sets the locale names from the     system&#039;s regional/language settings (accessible via Control Panel).          
返回值:
  返回值     Returns the new current locale, or FALSE if the locale functionality is   not implemented on your platform, the specified locale does not exist or   the category name is invalid.       An invalid category name also causes a warning message. Category/locale   names can be found in &raquo;&nbsp;RFC 1766   and &raquo;&nbsp;ISO 639.   Different systems have different naming schemes for locales.    Note:        The return value of setlocale() depends    on the system that PHP is running.  It returns exactly    what the system setlocale function returns.      
示例:

<?php
/* Set locale to Dutch */
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nl_NL');
/* Output: vrijdag 22 december 1978 */
echo strftime("%A %e %B %Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 22, 1978));
/* try different possible locale names for german as of PHP 4.3.0 */
$loc_de = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE@euro', 'de_DE', 'de', 'ge');
echo "Preferred locale for german on this system is '$loc_de'";
?>

<?php
/* Set locale to Dutch */
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nld_nld');
/* Output: vrijdag 22 december 1978 */
echo strftime("%A %d %B %Y", mktime(0, 0, 0, 12, 22, 1978));
/* try different possible locale names for german as of PHP 4.3.0 */
$loc_de = setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE@euro', 'de_DE', 'deu_deu');
echo "Preferred locale for german on this system is '$loc_de'";
?>

语法:
   string timezone_name_from_abbr    ( string $abbr   [, int $gmtOffset = -1   [, int $isdst = -1  ]] )
参数:
  参数              abbr                  Time zone abbreviation.                        gmtOffset                  Offset from GMT in seconds. Defaults to -1 which means that first found       time zone corresponding to abbr is returned.       Otherwise exact offset is searched and only if not found then the first       time zone with any offset is returned.                        isdst                  Daylight saving time indicator. Defaults to -1, which means that       whether the time zone has daylight saving or not is not taken into       consideration when searching. If this is set to 1, then the       gmtOffset is assumed to be an offset with       daylight saving in effect; if 0, then gmtOffset       is assumed to be an offset without daylight saving in effect. If       abbr doesn&#039;t exist then the time zone is       searched solely by the gmtOffset and       isdst.                     
返回值:
  返回值     Returns time zone name on success 或者在失败时返回 FALSE.   
示例:

<?php
echo timezone_name_from_abbr("CET") . "\n";
echo timezone_name_from_abbr("", 3600, 0) . "\n";
?>
以上例程的输出类似于：
Europe/Berlin
Europe/Paris
